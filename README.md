Hi, This is a project made on Vite. You can access the website through this URL ::

The project is using THREE.JS to build a 3D sphere which changes its colour when user drags or rotates the sphere.
 
You can also run the project by downloading the code , run *npm install* from the root directory of the project from you terminal to install required dependencies, then run *npm run build* to run the project on local host.
